# pivot-nav-bar
 second pre-work pivot project! this one is just a simple fixed navigation bar. there are definitley things I feel like I'm getting the hang of, and certain things I'm still trying to grasp, but I'm excited that I was able to learn how to target light/dark modes as supported! <a href="https://jhbforlife-pivot-nav-bar.netlify.app" target="_blank">you can view the deployed project here</a>

issues for future:
- Canvas & CanvasText not supported on iOS Safari, implement prefers-color-scheme
